# Pwd_How_Climate_Impacts_on_Agriculture_Supply
I wanted to explore the possibility of utilizing data science approaches to summarize my dataset on how climate change affects agricultural supplies. I plan to conduct study on the relationship between climate change and agricultural productivity, as well as what is causing the increase in global temperature at a greater level.

I decided to focus on world agriculture land percentage and choose a suitable country that is severely impacted by global warming. To my knowledge, no data science methodologies have been used for detail work analysis on this topic.

For this project proposal, my aims are to:

- Determine which country should be used for a more in-depth analysis.
- Clean and modify the data so that it can be used in the approaches I want to apply later.
- Select some specific data from different dataframe and store it in a new dataframe for data analysis.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in the data that allow for additional analysis.
